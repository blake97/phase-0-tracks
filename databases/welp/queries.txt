2) You've joined two tables before. How do you join three?

SELECT * 
FROM   businesses AS b, 
       reviews AS r, 
       users AS u 
WHERE  r.user_id = u.id 
       AND r.business_id = b.id;

3)There are some repetitive columns if we choose to view all fields. Choose instead to just view the user's names, the business name, the star rating, and the comment.

SELECT users.first, 
       users.last, 
       businesses.name, 
       reviews.stars, 
       reviews.comment 
FROM   users, 
       businesses 
       JOIN reviews 
        ON reviews.user_id = users.id 
        AND reviews.business_id = businesses.id;

4) How do you view the data of all three tables for just one particular business? 

select *
from users,
businesses
join reviews
   ON reviews.user_id = users.id 
    AND reviews.business_id = businesses.id
where businesses.name = "Lotus Yoga";
