  <h1>Check out how I use this JavaScript and Stuff...</h1>
    <p>Today, I was walking my dog, and he pulled free of the leash after being scared by some fruits falling out of the tree. He then started running and wouldn't listen to me... like, at all. Oh, did I mention that I live in NYC? We ran across 2 avenues and down two blocks. I was so furious and scared at the same time. Luckily, he didn't get hit, and he ran all the way back home. I came around the corner of th block to find him pooping in front of my door.</p>
