What is the purpose of HTML5 semantic tags? Which ones do you see as most useful?

- article Defines an article
- aside Defines content aside from the page content
- details Defines additional details that the user can view or hide
- figcaption Defines a caption for a figure element
- figure Specifies self-contained content, like illustrations, diagrams, photos, code listings, etc.
- footer  Defines a footer for a document or section
- header  Specifies a header for a document or section
- main  Specifies the main content of a document
- mark  Defines marked/highlighted text
- nav Defines navigation links
- section Defines a section in a document
- summary Defines a visible heading for a details element
- time  Defines a date/time
