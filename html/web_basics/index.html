    <h1>Hello, world. Check out this page on aquarium fish!</h1>
    <p>I've had fish since I was a kid. My parents never wanted me to have them, but my grandmother surprised us all- <em> especially my parents </em> -one Christmas with an aquarium set. It's been my <strong>obsession </strong> ever since. ;) </p>

    <h2>So, Let me tell you why my parents didn't want me to have an aquarium, in order of greatest to least importance.</h2>

    <ol>
      <li>They knew I'd make a mess. </li>
      <li>They knew I'd insist on keeping the aquarium after I made a mess.</li>
      <li>They knew I'd want more aquariums.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Sooooo.... why was I obsessed with aquariums?</h2>

    <ul>
      <li>I love biology... in no particular order.</li>
      <li> I love making things grow- I've been told I'm really obsessed with the act of husbandry.</li>
      <li> I love being in water/working with it... and secretly, I've always wanted to be able to live underwater. </li>

      In college, i had about 7,000 gallons worth of aquariums... this isn't purely for obsessive purposes, however. In fact, I made a business in college that involved me breeding and selling aquarium plants and animals acoss the United States! One of the websites I used to sell my work was <a href= "http://aquabid.com">Aquabid Marketplace </a>
    </ul>
